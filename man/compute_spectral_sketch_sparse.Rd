\title{Compute spectral sketch `U_orig_i` using `RSpectra` or `base::eigen`}
\usage{
compute_spectral_sketch_sparse(L_conn_i_sparse, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{L_conn_i_sparse}{A sparse graph Laplacian matrix (`Matrix::dgCMatrix`, `V_p x V_p`).
Must be symmetric.}

\item{k}{An integer, the desired spectral rank. Must be `k >= 0`.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
  - `vectors`: A dense matrix `U_orig_i` (`V_p x k_actual`) of eigenvectors.
    `k_actual` may be less than `k` if not enough informative eigenvectors are found.
  - `values`: A vector of eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors.
}
\description{
Computes the `k` eigenvectors of the sparse graph Laplacian `L_conn_i_sparse`
corresponding to the smallest, non-trivial eigenvalues.
Eigenvectors for eigenvalues numerically close to zero are discarded based on a dynamic tolerance.
