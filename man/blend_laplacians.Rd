\title{Blend Connectivity and Task Laplacians}
\usage{
blend_laplacians(L_conn, L_task, lambda_blend_value, method = "linear")
}
\arguments{
\item{L_conn}{A sparse Laplacian matrix derived from connectivity (`dgCMatrix`, `V_p x V_p`).}

\item{L_task}{A sparse Laplacian matrix derived from task activations/encodings
(`dgCMatrix`, `V_p x V_p`). Must have the same dimensions as `L_conn`.}

\item{lambda_blend_value}{Numeric, the blending factor (`λ`). Must be between 0 and 1.
`L_hybrid = (1 - λ) * L_conn + λ * L_task`.}

\item{method}{Character string, the blending method. Currently only "linear" is supported.}
}
\value{
The blended sparse Laplacian matrix `L_hybrid` (`dgCMatrix`, `V_p x V_p`).
}
\description{
Combines a connectivity-based Laplacian and a task-based Laplacian using
a specified blending method. Currently, only linear blending is supported.
