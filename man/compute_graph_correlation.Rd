\title{Compute Correlation Between Two Sparse Graphs}
\usage{
compute_graph_correlation(W_graph1, W_graph2, max_edges = 2e+06)
}
\arguments{
\item{W_graph1}{A sparse, symmetric matrix (`Matrix::dgCMatrix`, `V_p x V_p`).
Assumed to have z-scored non-zero entries.}

\item{W_graph2}{A sparse, symmetric matrix (`Matrix::dgCMatrix`, `V_p x V_p`).
Assumed to have z-scored non-zero entries.}

\item{max_edges}{An integer or `Inf`. If the number of unique edges in the
union of the upper triangles exceeds `max_edges`, a random sample of
`max_edges` edges will be used for the correlation calculation. Defaults to 2,000,000.}
}
\value{
The Spearman correlation coefficient (`rho`) between the edge weights
  of the two graphs based on the union of their upper triangle edges. Returns `NA`
  if correlation cannot be computed (e.g., too few edges, zero variance).
}
\description{
Calculates the Spearman correlation between the edge weights of two sparse graphs,
considering the union of their non-zero edges and filling missing edges with 0.
Only the upper triangle of the matrices is considered.
