\title{Calculate Reconstruction Error for HATSA Projector Objects}
\usage{
reconstruction_error(object, type = "anchors", ...)

\method{reconstruction_error}{hatsa_projector}(object, type = "anchors", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{hatsa_projector} object.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of reconstruction error to compute.
One of:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{"anchors"} (Default): Error between subject-specific aligned anchor sketches
        and the group anchor template (`T_anchor_final`).}
  \item{\code{"all_parcels"}: Error between original subject sketches (`U_original_list`)
        and sketches reconstructed from aligned versions via inverse rotation.
        (Sanity check, should be near zero if rotations are orthogonal).}
  \item{\code{"non_anchors"}: Error in predicting non-anchor parcel sketches from
        anchor parcel sketches in the aligned space (Anchor Residual `ε̄`).}
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, potentially passed to internal helper functions
(e.g., for non-anchor prediction methods).}
}
\value{
A named list containing reconstruction error metrics. The structure depends
  on the `type` requested, typically including `mean_error` and `per_subject_error`.
  For `type="non_anchors"`, it also includes `per_parcel_error`.
}
\description{
Computes various types of reconstruction errors based on a fitted HATSA model.
This helps quantify alignment quality, sanity check model components, or assess
how well non-anchor information is captured.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `fit_obj` is a hatsa_projector from `run_hatsa_core()`
# Anchor reconstruction error
# reconstruction_error(fit_obj, type = "anchors")
# Sanity check using all parcels
# reconstruction_error(fit_obj, type = "all_parcels")
# Predict non-anchor parcels from anchors
# reconstruction_error(fit_obj, type = "non_anchors")
