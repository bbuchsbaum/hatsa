\title{Common HATSA Pitfalls and Solutions}
\description{
Guide to avoiding common issues when using HATSA.
}
\section{Pitfall 1 - Too Many Components}{

Using too many components relative to your data size can lead to overfitting.

Solution: Use hatsa_suggest() or keep components < 10% of voxels.
}

\section{Pitfall 2 - Mismatched Dimensions}{

All subjects must have the same number of voxels (spatial alignment).

Solution: Ensure all subjects are in the same space/parcellation.
}

\section{Pitfall 3 - Including Bad Subjects}{

Subjects with excessive motion or artifacts can degrade alignment.

Solution: Pre-screen subjects and exclude outliers.
}

\section{Pitfall 4 - Wrong Preprocessing}{

HATSA expects centered data (zero mean per voxel).

Solution: Always scale/center your data before HATSA.
}

\section{Pitfall 5 - Ignoring Convergence Warnings}{

Warnings about convergence indicate potential issues.

Solution: Check your data quality and try different parameters.
