\title{Compute Pairwise Riemannian Distances Between Subject SPD Representations}
\usage{
riemannian_distance_matrix_spd(object, ...)

\method{riemannian_distance_matrix_spd}{hatsa_projector}(
  object,
  type = "cov_coeffs",
  subject_data_list = NULL,
  spd_regularize_epsilon = 1e-06,
  k_conn_params = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `hatsa_projector` or `task_hatsa_projector` object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `riemannian_distance_spd` or
to `get_spd_representations` if used.}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of SPD representation to use.
Commonly `"cov_coeffs"` (default) for the `k x k` covariance of aligned
spectral coefficients. Other types (e.g., `"fc_conn"`, `"fc_task"`) would
rely on `get_spd_representations` (from RGEOM-003) to provide the SPD matrices.}

\item{subject_data_list}{Optional. A list of subject time-series matrices
(T_i x V_p). May be needed by `get_spd_representations` for certain `type` values.}

\item{spd_regularize_epsilon}{Epsilon for regularizing SPD matrices.}

\item{k_conn_params}{Parameters for connectivity calculation if type involves FC,
passed to `get_spd_representations`.}
}
\value{
A symmetric `N_subjects x N_subjects` matrix of pairwise Riemannian distances.
  Diagonal will be zero. `NA` if a distance cannot be computed.
}
\description{
Calculates a matrix of Riemannian distances (Log-Euclidean metric)
between subjects, based on specified SPD matrix representations derived from
the HATSA object (e.g., covariance of aligned coefficients or various FC matrices).
