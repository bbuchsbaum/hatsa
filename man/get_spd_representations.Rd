\arguments{
\item{object}{A `hatsa_projector` or `task_hatsa_projector` object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, potentially passed to specific computation functions.}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of SPD representation to use.
Currently supported for `hatsa_projector`:
`"cov_coeffs"` (covariance of aligned spectral coefficients).
Other types like `"fc_conn"` might be added or supported by specific methods.}

\item{subject_idx}{Optional integer or vector of integers. If provided, returns
SPD matrices only for these subjects. If NULL (default), for all subjects.}

\item{regularize_epsilon}{Small positive value for SPD regularization. Default from RGEOM-001.}

\item{subject_data_list_for_fc}{Optional list of subject time-series matrices
(T_i x V_p), needed for `type = "fc_conn"`.}

\item{k_conn_params_for_fc}{List of parameters for `compute_subject_connectivity_graph_sparse`,
e.g., `list(k_conn_pos = 10, k_conn_neg = 10, zscore_type = "abs", ...)`.
Needed for `type = "fc_conn"`.}
}
\value{
If `subject_idx` has length 1, a single SPD matrix is returned.
  Otherwise a list of matrices is returned with `NULL` for subjects whose SPD
  representation could not be computed.
}
\description{
Extracts or computes various types of Symmetric Positive-Definite (SPD) matrix
representations for subjects from a `hatsa_projector` object.
