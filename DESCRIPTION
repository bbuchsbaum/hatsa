Title: Hyperalignment via Task-informed Shared Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Brad", "Buchsbaum", , "brad.buchsbaum@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements advanced hyperalignment methods for functional neuroimaging data
    with task-informed features. Provides sparse graph-based alignment of functional
    connectivity patterns across subjects using spectral decomposition and Procrustes
    alignment. Includes extensions for task-informed alignment, Riemannian geometry
    operations on SPD manifolds, and voxel-level projection via NystrÃ¶m extension.
